# paint-tank-tasm-x86-game
a game in tasm x86.

It's a game whose goal is to paint as much of the total area in yourcolor as possible (there are three colors red, blue and green). While you control a tank when it passes over a tile it paints it in its color. Control of the tank is only through its horizontal and vertical speed.
